## Settings

### Main Settings

In the `src/index.js` file, you can modify the following main settings:

#### Payment Method

Choose the payment method for handling donations:

##### - `"client-side"`: Create products on Stripe with a minimum price, allowing users to select their donation amount on the foundation site.
Pros:
- **User-Friendly Experience:** Enables users to select their donation amount directly on the foundation site, enhancing user experience.
- **Redirection Control:** Allows redirection after successful or unsuccessful payments.
- **No Server Dependency:** Removes the need for a server, simplifying the architecture and reducing maintenance overhead.

Cons:
- **Checkout Page Details:** Displays potentially confusing information like "Qty 500, â‚¬0.01 each" on the Stripe checkout page, as products are created with minimum prices and than multipied to get final price.

##### - `"link"`: Set Stripe links for products with "customer chooses price" on the Stripe website.
Pros:
- **Secure Donation Amount Choice:** Donation amount is chosen on the Stripe website, potentially increasing user trust in the security of the transaction.
- **Detailed Stripe Confirmation:** Displays a "Thanks for your donation" message on the Stripe website, providing clear confirmation to donors.

Cons:
- **No Redirection Control:** Lacks the ability to redirect users after successful or unsuccessful payments, potentially affecting user experience.
- **Limited Donation Amount Selection:** Users cannot choose the donation amount on the foundation site, which may lead to a less personalized experience.

##### - `"server"`: Generate Stripe links on the server in real-time.
Pros:
- **Dynamic Donation Amount:** Allows users to select their donation amount on the foundation site, providing a personalized experience.
- **No Redirects:** Smooth user experience with no redirections during the donation process.

Cons:
- **Server Dependency:** Requires a server to generate payment links in real-time, introducing an additional layer of complexity and maintenance.
- **Potential Latency:** Depending on server load, there may be slight delays in generating payment links, impacting the responsiveness of the donation process.

Example:
```javascript
const paymentMethod = "server";
```

### Currency Settings

Adjust currency settings, including zero-decimal currencies and divisible-by-hundred currencies.

Example:
```javascript
const zeroDecimalCurrencies = ["BIF", "CLP", "DJF", ...];
const divisableByHundredCurrencies = ["ISK", "UGX"];
```

### Website Data

Set static and dynamic data for the website.

### Server Method

Specify the URL for the server's `createPaymentIntent` method for the server payment method.

Example:
```javascript
const createPaymentIntentUrl = "http://localhost:3003/api/create-payment-intent";
```

### API Endpoints

Configure the URLs for server API endpoints for submitting forms and fetching donation information.

Example:
```javascript
const submitQuestionFormUrl = 'http://localhost:3003/api/submitForm';
const getDonationGoalDataUrl = 'http://localhost:3003/api/getDonationGoalData';
const getLatestDonationsDataUrl = 'http://localhost:3003/api/getLatestDonationsData';
```

### Fundraisers

Set up multiple fundraisers with specific details, including paths, titles, descriptions, donation amounts, and rewards.

Example:
```javascript
const fundraisersData = [
  {
    path: "clean-water-project",
    title: "Clean Water Project for Rural Communities",
    // ...other details
  },
  {
    path: "tram-ad-campaign",
    title: "Create Ad Campaign in the Tram",
    // ...other details
  },
  // Add more fundraisers as needed
];
```

## UI Settings

Adjust the appearance of the website by modifying variables in the `Shared.scss` file. Customize donation buttons, form text, and more.

Example:
```scss
// Example UI settings in Shared.scss
// Colors Variables
$font-main-color: #222222;
$font-text-color: #22222277;
$font-bright-color: #FFFFFF;

$container-background: #FFFFFF;

$color-main: #9C79E7;
$color-accent: #F5E6DC;
$color-accent-2: #E4B290;
$color-accent-3: #F0DDD1;
$color-mild: #2222221D;
$color-error: #e77979;
// ...other UI settings
```
